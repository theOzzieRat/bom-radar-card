# bom-radar-card
Moved to https://github.com/makin-things/bom-radar-card

On the 25 Sep 2021 the repository was relocated to a new GitHub account with the release of v1.3.4. If you currently have it installed using HACS you will need to go into HACS and remove the old custom repository (the three dots up the top right) and add the new repository and then update the card. The link below has been updated to the new location. Your existing configs will not be lost.
Sorry for any inconvenience.
